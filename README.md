# The CCNC
A Cheap (Relatively), yet capable CNC router/mill
<br> 
-----

The Goal for this project is to create a relatively cheap (Sub $500CAD) CNC Machine that is capable of cutting wood, plastics and soft metals. 

This machine utilizes many 3D Printed parts in order to keep costs down, assuming you already have a 3D Printer. Some printed parts have off the shelf alternatives, some can also be replicated in wood using basic hand tools, while other (Mainly the X Gantry Uprights) have to be printed. More information is found in the documents.

The machine/files should be relatively adapatble to different use cases

This guide will provide an overview of my design choices as well as a basic assembly guide.

# Parts (bill of materials)

The Bill of Materials is available in multiple versions
PDF
Spreadsheet
Markdown

There are a few tools that are required to put this machine together;

* Metric Hex/Allen Keys
* Jigsaw with metal cutting blades/Chop saw (Essentially some way to cut the aluminum extrusions and leadscrews)
* M5 Tap Drill
* Circular Saw (To cut the MDF Spoilboard)
* Drill bit set


# Prepare Raw Materials

#### 1. Print and Prepare required parts
Follow the Print Settings file in the STLs Folder

#### 2. Cut Aluminum Extrusions
Follow the Cutlist file, I would recomend not cutting the X Axis extrusions until the uprights are mounted in order to get a snug fit. 

#### 3. Tap Aluminum Extrusions
All of the extrusions need to be threaded with an M5x0.50 tap, except for the 2 frame crossmembers.

#### 4. Cut Lead Screws
Follow the cutlist file if you need to cut your leadscrews, if you purchase the legnths I listed in the parts list, there is no cutting required

# Build the Machine

## 1. Assemble the frame

#### 1. Mounting the Extrusions
Start by mounting a pair of 520mm extrusions to each pair of brackets as shown in the photo (Using M5x20 SHCS). Then attach the 450mm Crossmembers using the corner brackets.

#### 2. Mount the Linear Rails
Mount the 500mm Linear rails on top of the top most frame rail using M3x8 SHCS as well as M3 T-Nuts. Leave 10mm of gap on either side of the rail.

#### 3. Mount the Pillow Blocks

#### 4. Mount Stepper motors 

## 2. Assemble the X Axis Gantry

#### 1. Mount Linear Rails

#### 2. Mount Extusions to Uprights

#### 3. Install Pillow Blocks, Stepper motor

## 3. Attach X Axis to Base

#### 1. Mount the uprights to linear rails

#### 2. Install Lead Screws

## 4. Assemble Z Axis Gantry

#### 1. Mount the Linear Rails

#### 2. Mount the Motor

#### 3. Attach Z Axis to X Axis

#### 4. Attach Spindle Mounting Plate

#### 5. Install Lead Screw

#### 6. Install Spindle

## 5. Wire up the Machine
