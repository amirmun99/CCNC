# The CCNC
A Cheap (Relatively), yet capable CNC router/mill
<br> 
-----

The Goal for this project is to create a relatively cheap (Sub $500CAD) CNC Machine that is capable of cutting wood, plastics and soft metals. 

This machine utilizes many 3D Printed parts in order to keep costs down, assuming you already have a 3D Printer. Some printed parts have off the shelf alternatives, some can also be replicated in wood using basic hand tools, while other (Mainly the X Gantry Uprights) have to be printed. More information is found in the documents.

This guide will provide an overview of my design choices as well as a step-by-step guide on how to make your own, starting from scratch.

There are a few tools that are required to put this machine together;

* Metric Hex/Allen Keys
* Jigsaw with metal cutting blades/Chop saw (Essentially some way to cut the aluminum extrusions and leadscrews)
* M6 Tap Drill
* Circular Saw (To cut the MDF Spoilboard)
